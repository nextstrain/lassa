# rules to support the Nextstrain automation that upload files and send internal
# Slack notifications.
# For extensions, the user will have to specify the custom rule targets when
# running the workflow.
# For overrides, the custom Snakefile will have to use the `ruleorder` directive
# to allow Snakemake to handle ambiguous rules
